# US Colleges and Universities

## Description

This is the repository for a website that provides relevant information
for international applicants to US Colleges and Universities.

It was designed as part of a class project for COMS 4170 UI Design class
at Columbia University taught by Prof. Lydia Chilton in Spring 2022.

It is currently more of a prototype and only displays (more or less
hard-coded) information for 10 US schools.
